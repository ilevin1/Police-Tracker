# Police Tracker – Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-08-11

Police Tracker (the "App") helps users view nearby police-related traffic alerts and heatmaps. We take your privacy seriously and aim to collect as little personal data as possible.

## Information We Collect

- Location (device-only): With your permission, the App accesses your device’s location to center the map and show nearby alerts. Your location is processed on-device for map rendering and is not stored on our servers.
- Usage data (minimal): We may collect basic, non-identifying technical logs required for app reliability and security. We do not use analytics that identify you.
- Police alerts data: The alerts you see are sourced from third-party and community datasets. This data is not linked to you.

## How We Use Information

- To display nearby alerts and heatmaps based on your current map view
- To improve reliability, troubleshoot issues, and protect against abuse

## Data Sharing

- We do not sell your personal information.
- We do not share your location or personal information with advertisers.
- Third-party map tiles and APIs (e.g., Google Maps) may process standard network metadata when loading maps.

## Data Retention

- We do not store your device location.
- We retain only non-identifying technical logs as needed for reliability and security.

## Security

We use industry-standard measures to protect information in transit and at rest. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child provided us information, contact us and we will take appropriate action.

## Your Choices

- Location permissions can be managed in your device settings.
- You may uninstall the App at any time.

## Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party services, which have their own privacy practices:

- Google Maps Platform (maps/visualization)
  - Privacy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

- Community/third-party traffic alert sources (e.g., Waze datasets) for public alerts
